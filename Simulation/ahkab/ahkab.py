Introduction
============

This is the core module of the simulator. It provides helper functions to save
you the need to call directly the functions in most submodules.

Do you have a circuit?
======================

To run a simulation, you'll need a circuit first: a circuit can be described
with a simulation deck or with a circuit object.

Define your circuit by means of a Circuit object
------------------------------------------------

In a Python script, describing the circuit through the
:class:`ahkab.circuit.Circuit` interface is a very versatile a choice.

Refer to :class:`ahkab.circuit.Circuit` for a complete description of the
process and the documentation of several helper functions to assist you in this
task.

You may then jump to :ref:`create-simulation-object`.

Define your circuit by means of a netlist file
----------------------------------------------

The circuit description can also be provided as a text file, also known as
netlist deck, for historical reason. This file will also typically include
simulation and post-processing directives, such as plotting.

The netlist should be described according to the rules in
:doc:`help/Netlist-Syntax`.

If you have a netlist (simulation deck) available, you have several possibilities.

The first, assuming your netlist defines some simulation would be to run it:

* you may call ``ahkab`` from the command line. The command line interface is
  described in :doc:`help/Command-Line-Help`.
* you may call :func:`main` directly from Python. Running the simulation through
  :func:`main` function allows to process the result in Python.

Alternatively, you may parse the netlist through
:func:`ahkab.netlist_parser.parse_circuit`, which will return the circuit
instance, all the simulations defined in the deck and all the post-processing
directives as well.

You may now modify the circuit and simulation objects as you please, or create
new ones, as well as run them as described in the :ref:`run-it` section.

.. _create-simulation-object:

How to create a simulation object
=================================

Next, you need to have a simulation object you would like to run.

The following functions are available to quickly create a simulation object:

.. autosummary::
    new_ac
    new_dc
    new_op
    new_pss
    new_pz
    new_symbolic
    new_tran

Click on one of the above hyperlinks to be taken to the corresponding
documentation section.

.. note::

    The functions above allow you to specify an output file. This is due to two
    main reasons:

    * Saving to a file allows you to keep a copy of the simulation results,
      which you can then inspect at a later time.
    * Simulation results may take an uncomfortably large amount of memory. The
      approach we take is that we save everything to file, and only load the
      data to memory when the user actually accesses it.

    In order for the latter to work when no output file is specified, ``ahkab``
    stores the simulation data in a temporary file provided by your OS. When the
    user exits the Python interpreter (or IPython or debugger), the file is
    removed.

.. _run-it:

Run it!
=======

Once you have a circuit and one or more simulations, it's time to run them!

The following methods are available to do so:

.. autosummary::
    run
    queue

The :func:`run` function will return the results in dictionary form.

Extras
======

The core module also contains a few extra methods which were deemed important
enough to be inserted here.

In particular, the :func:`get_op_x0` method allows the user to quickly compute
an operating point to be used to specify the linearization point for a more
complex analysis and :func:`icmodified_x0` allows the user to modify said
operating point to take into account the user-specified initial conditions in
the circuit description.

Lastly, :func:`set_temperature` can be used to quickly set the simulation
temperature.

All methods in alphabetical order

    source : string, optional

        voltage source ``source`` and each circuit unknown will be

        ``source`` is to be set to the ``part_id`` of an independent current

        computation should be avoided for large circuit, as indiscriminate
        transfer function, gain and singularities evaluation in large
        circuits can result in very long run times and needs a significant
        amount of RAM, on top of an already resource intensive symbolic
        analysis.  We suggest manually evaluating selected transfer
        functions of interest instead.

    ac_enable : bool, optional
        If set to ``True`` (default), the frequency-dependent elements will
        be considered, otherwise the algorithm will focus on
        low frequency solutions, where all capacitors are replaced with open
        circuits and all inductors are short circuits, usually providing a much
        easier circuit.

    r0s : bool, optional
        If set to ``True``, the finite output conductances of transistors
        ``go`` (where :math:`go = 1/r_0`) will be taken into account,
        otherwise they will be considered infinite (default).
        The finite output conductances generally introduce a significant
        additional complexity in large circuits, sometimes of interest to the
        designer, sometimes simply introducing 2nd and 3rd order effects of
        little-to-no interest, which would produce no significant contribution
        in a numerical analysis, but come at a high computation price in a
        symbolic analysis.
        A possible approach in those cases may be disabling this option and
        explicitly introducing additional conductances where deemed of interest.

    subs : dict, optional
        ``subs`` is a dictionary of substitutions to be performed before
        attempting to solve the circuit. For example, if two
        resistances ``R1`` and ``R2`` are to be equal, set ``subs={'R2':'R1'}``
        and ``R1`` will be replaced by an instance of ``R2``. This may

        time for complex circuits).

    - to specify a nodal voltage: ``{'V(node)':<voltage value>}``
    - to specify a branch current: ``'I(<element>)':<current value>}``
